Thank you for the opportunity to take this interview test.

Taking this further I would have liked to have done more with error handling, filtering, 
auto complete, and linking across the app. For example, providing the option
to run an ingredients search from the cocktail detail pages. 

To run this locally, please run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Thanks
